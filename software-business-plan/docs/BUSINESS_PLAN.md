# NordBridge Labs — Business Plan

## Company Overview

**Legal Name:** NordBridge Labs Inc.
**Jurisdiction:** Federal incorporation, Canada (Industry Canada / Corporations Canada)
**Operating Regions:** Canada, European Union (Germany as primary EU hub)
**Founded:** 2026
**Headquarters:** Canada (remote-first)
**EU Operations:** Germany

---

## 1. Executive Summary

NordBridge Labs is a cross-Atlantic software consultancy and product studio specializing in **AI-enhanced SaaS development** and **privacy-compliant data engineering** for companies operating across North American and European markets.

We solve a specific, growing pain point: mid-market companies (50–500 employees) that sell or operate in both North America and the EU struggle to build software that satisfies diverging regulatory frameworks (GDPR, PIPEDA, Quebec Law 25, the EU AI Act) while keeping up with the AI integration race. Engineering teams are stretched thin, compliance consultants don't write code, and big consultancies are prohibitively expensive.

NordBridge Labs sits at the intersection — a small, senior engineering team distributed across Canada and Germany that delivers production-grade, regulation-aware software.

**Revenue target Year 1:** CAD 300K–500K
**Revenue target Year 3:** CAD 1.5M–2.5M
**Team:** 3 co-founders (1 Canada-based, 2 Germany-based)

## 2. The Business Idea

### Problem

1. **Regulatory fragmentation**: Companies expanding from Canada to the EU (or vice versa) face GDPR, PIPEDA, Quebec Law 25, and the EU AI Act — each with different consent models, data residency rules, and documentation requirements.
2. **AI adoption pressure**: Every B2B SaaS company needs to integrate AI features, but doing so compliantly (especially under the EU AI Act which classifies AI systems by risk) requires specialized knowledge.
3. **Talent scarcity**: Senior engineers who understand both privacy engineering and AI/ML are rare and expensive to hire full-time.
4. **Cost of big consultancies**: Deloitte, Accenture, and McKinsey charge $300–$500/hr. Mid-market companies cannot justify those costs for ongoing engineering work.

### Solution

NordBridge Labs offers three service lines:

| Service | Description | Typical Engagement |
|---|---|---|
| **Cross-Border SaaS Development** | Build new SaaS products or features that are compliant by design across CA/EU jurisdictions | 3–9 month projects, $80K–$300K |
| **AI Integration Engineering** | Add AI/ML capabilities (LLM integration, predictive analytics, automation) to existing products with EU AI Act compliance baked in | 2–6 month projects, $50K–$200K |
| **Privacy & Data Architecture Audits** | Audit existing systems for GDPR/PIPEDA compliance, redesign data flows, implement consent management and data residency controls | 2–8 week engagements, $15K–$60K |

### Why This Is Relevant Now (2026)

- The **EU AI Act** enforcement began in 2025, and companies are scrambling to classify and document their AI systems.
- **Quebec Law 25** (full enforcement since Sept 2024) created Canada's strictest privacy law, pushing national standards upward.
- **CETA** (Canada-EU trade agreement) continues to drive cross-border business expansion.
- AI integration is no longer optional — it's table-stakes for B2B SaaS retention.

## 4. Target Market

### Primary Segments

**Segment A — Canadian SaaS companies expanding to the EU**
- 50–500 employees
- Series A to Series C funded
- Already have product-market fit in Canada/US
- Need to adapt their product for GDPR, data residency, and EU AI Act
- Examples: fintech, healthtech, HR-tech, e-commerce platforms

**Segment B — German/EU Mittelstand companies entering North America**
- Traditional mid-market companies digitizing operations
- Building customer-facing SaaS products for the first time
- Need North American market understanding and PIPEDA compliance
- Examples: manufacturing, logistics, professional services

**Segment C — Cross-border startups (born global)**
- Early-stage companies with founders/teams split across CA and EU
- Need a technical partner who understands both ecosystems from day one

### Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|

| SAM (Mid-market compliance-aware development) | ~$800M |
| SOM (Year 3 realistic capture) | ~$2.5M |

## 5. Competitive Advantage

1. **Genuine cross-border presence**: Not just a Canadian company that "also serves EU." We have engineers on the ground in Germany, operating in EU timezone, understanding EU business culture.
2. **Engineering + compliance in one team**: Competitors are either pure compliance consultants (no code) or pure dev shops (no regulatory depth). We do both.
3. **Senior-only team**: No juniors, no bench. Every person on a project has 5+ years of experience. Clients get direct access to the people doing the work.
4. **Cost advantage over big consultancies**: Our blended rate ($150–$200/hr CAD) is 40–60% lower than Big 4 consultancies while delivering more specialized expertise.
5. **CETA + tax advantages**: Canadian federal incorporation provides access to SR&ED tax credits for R&D work. CETA facilitates trade with the EU.

---

## 8. Legal & Operational Structure

### Corporate Structure
- **NordBridge Labs Inc.** — Canadian federal corporation (primary entity)
- **NordBridge Labs GmbH** (or UG) — German subsidiary or branch office (establish in Year 1 or early Year 2 depending on EU contract volume)
- Use contractor agreements for Germany-based co-founders initially; convert to GmbH employment when revenue justifies it

### Key Legal Considerations
- **CETA**: Enables easier movement of professionals and service trade between CA and EU
- **SR&ED Tax Credits**: Claim Canadian R&D tax credits on qualifying engineering work (potentially $30K–$60K/year return)
- **Transfer Pricing**: Document arm's-length pricing between CA and DE entities when GmbH is established
- **Data Processing Agreements**: Standard GDPR DPAs for all client engagements
- **Professional Liability Insurance**: E&O insurance covering both CA and EU operations

### IP Strategy
- All IP owned by the Canadian parent entity
- Client contracts use "work for hire" with clear IP assignment clauses
- Internal tools and frameworks retained as company IP (potential future product)

| Cross-border tax complexity | Medium | Medium | Engage a specialized cross-border accountant from day one |
| Competition from larger consultancies | Low | Medium | Stay in mid-market niche; compete on specialization and price, not scale |

---

## 12. Exit / Long-Term Vision

**Year 1–3:** Services-led growth, build reputation and recurring revenue.
**Year 3–5:** Launch a SaaS product (cross-border compliance automation toolkit) alongside services.
**Year 5+:** Product revenue exceeds services revenue. Potential outcomes:
- Continue as a profitable, lifestyle-scale product company
- Raise funding to scale the product aggressively
- Acquisition target for larger compliance/GRC platforms (OneTrust, Vanta, Drata)
